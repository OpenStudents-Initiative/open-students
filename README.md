**Unleashing the Power of Student-Driven Course and Professor Reviews**

OpenStudents is a modern web platform designed to empower students to make informed decisions about their education. Our core philosophy centers around transparency and the belief that access to peer-generated insights is crucial in navigating the often complex world of higher education.

## Key Features
